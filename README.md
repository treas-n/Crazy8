## Objective
The aim of the game is to play all your cards. In the beginning, each player is dealt four cards. The players take turns playing their cards. Each turn, a player has to play a card with the same rank or suit as the top card on the pile. Players who can’t meet these requirements must draw a card from the draw pile, however, they can't play that card on the same turn. There are four types of special cards.
