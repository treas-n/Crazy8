## Objective
 The aim of the game is to play all your cards onto the pile. In the beginning, each player is dealt four cards. The players take turns playing their cards. Each turn, a player has to play a card with the same number or suit as the top card on the pile. If a player can’t meet these requirements, they have to pick up from the pile. There are four types of special cards.

## Special Cards
2: forces the next player to pick up 2 cards
7: Skips the next player’s turn
8: Change the suit of the pile
J: Reverses the direction of the play
